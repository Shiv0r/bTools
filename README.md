# Different Small Tools for Blender 4.2+

# PathChanger
PathChanger streamlines the tedious process of updating file paths after upgrading to a newer version of Blender or the portable version, allowing you to do it with a single click.

You can find PathChanger in the N-Panel under Tool.
Enter the full Blender version you are currently using (e.g., 4.2.0) and click "Change Paths".
PathChanger only works if Blender is installed in C:\Program Files\Blender

# Meshize
